# Released publicly for the benefit of last remaining seilors

> For some time, we were questioning as to whether or not Sei was a good foundation to build our teams future upon. For various reasons which we will publish in more detail later on our website, we've decided to discontinue our efforts on building on Sei in favour of Monad.
> 
> One of the key reasons is that the Sei's blockchain is in this weird spot where its native features are neglected and have been systematically removed, yet their EVM-compatible features remain incomplete. We cannot rely on Sei's unique native features to help make it better, and if we're going to pivot towards developing for the EVM, we might as well do it on a chain which has a more stable and complete implementation. Therefore, there is no reason for us to develop on Sei in favour of other EVM-compatible chains.
> 
> Monad promises first and foremost to be an upgrade to the EVM ecosystem from the ground-up, and we believe that it's in the best-interest of our team to capture that opportunity rather than putting in ever-increasing amounts of effort into making Sei "work".
